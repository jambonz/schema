## Vendor documentation links

Refer to vendor documentation for supported models and languages.

**Important**: jambonz requires real-time streaming STT. When choosing a model, ensure it supports real-time/streaming transcription. Models that only support batch transcription cannot be used.

### Deepgram
- When using Deepgram default to the latest nova model (e.g. nova-3)

### AssemblyAI

#### Prompting (Universal-3 Pro)

AssemblyAI's Universal-3 Pro streaming model supports a `prompt` parameter that guides transcription behavior around punctuation, disfluencies, formatting, and domain-specific terminology. The default prompt achieves strong turn detection accuracy out of the box — only customize if needed, and start by extending the default rather than replacing it.

- See [Prompting guide](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/streaming/universal-3-pro/prompting)

jambonz has an autogeneratePrompt recognizer setting which when used with AssemblyAI universal-3 pro streaming will automatically create the prompt for a gather verb based on the text in a nested say property.  See [here](../../examples/assemblyai-autogenerate-prompt/) for details.

A `keyterms` array can boost recognition of specific names, brands, or technical terms. This can be updated mid-stream, making it useful for voice agent scenarios where context changes during the call.

#### Voice Agent (Preview)

Speechmatics offers a Voice Agent API (currently in preview) that provides low-latency conversational AI capabilities. When using the Voice Agent API, set the `host` and `profile` properties in `speechmaticsOptions`:

- `host` - the Speechmatics Voice Agent endpoint URL
- `profile` - one of `adaptive`, `agile`, `smart`, or `external`

See [Voice Agent API documentation](https://docs.speechmatics.com/private/voice-agent-api#introduction) for details.
